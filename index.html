            <h3>we were at the last few weeks of college so we decided to maximize the time we had left together by
                embarking on a 12 hour road trip through the southwest. On our back from New Mexico, we stayed at an
                amazing Airbnb right in the heart of old town Tucson, Arizona. We thought it’d be a lovely idea to make
                our own meals at this quaint Airbnb and what a lovely idea it was. Our Airbnb also had such cute dishes
                and tablecloths that made this flatlay all the more perfect. It was a great morning spent in a great
                place with the greatest company.

                The companies that supply foodservice operators are called foodservice distributors. Foodservice
                distributors sell goods like small wares (kitchen utensils) and foods. Some companies manufacture
                products in both consumer and foodservice versions. The consumer version usually comes in
                individual-sized packages with elaborate label design for retail sale. The foodservice version is
                packaged in a much larger industrial size and often lacks the colorful label designs of the consumer
                version.
